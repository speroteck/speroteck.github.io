After some months of investigations, tries and failures we at last present
our own package manager for `PHP` libraries.
It is based on `composer` which contains a lot of features and the knowledge of it is a `must have` feature
of the modern developer.

It is located on [composer.speroteck.com](http://composer.speroteck.com).

Honestly I don't like their `strange` logo. But anyway it is hard to forget that `maestro` with "square" face.

### How to use it is extremely simple. Some examples to impress.

See full documentation on [composer](http://getcomposer.org) site and some examples in our repository [](https://gitlab.speroteck.com/speroteck/composer-repository/tree/master)
Don't forget to ask access to see content.
