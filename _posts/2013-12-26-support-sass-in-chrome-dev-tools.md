While working with Compass (sass), we have to have opportunity of debugging scss files.

![Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors-files/sass-debugging.png)

First of all we need correct compass and sass versions with source-map compatibility. 
* sass - 3.3.0.alpha.149 
* compass-sourcemaps - 0.12.2.sourcemaps.57a186c

Installtions:

```php
gem install sass -v 3.3.0.alpha.149 --pre
gem install compass-sourcemaps -v 0.12.2.sourcemaps.57a186c --pre
```

If you have different version, you can uninstall them by commands bellow:

```php
gem uninstall sass
gem uninstall compass
```

Now we need to update compass config by adding line:

```php
sass_options = {:sourcemap => true}
```

Ok. Let's make changes in chrome setting. 
To enable CSS source maps and CSS reload:

1. Open new tab with link chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments and enable "Developer Tools experiments" support. Reload your browser. 
2. Open DevTools Settings and click General. 
3. Turn on Enable CSS source maps and Auto-reload generated CSS.
